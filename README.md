# Loan-Default-Risk-Analysis

## Problem Overview

This case study aims to give an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. In this case study, we will apply the EDA techniques towards developing a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. 

This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

## CONCLUSION

- Young males with lower secondary education and of lower income group and staying with parents or in a rented house, applying for low-range cash contract, should be denied.
- Females are likely to repay but not if they are on maternity leave. Hence, bank can reduce the loan amount for female applicants who are on maternity leave.
- Since people taking cash loans for repairs and urgent needs are more likely to default, bank can refuse them.
- Since the people who have unused offers are more likely to default even though they have comparatively high total income, they can be offered loan at a higher interest rate.
- Banks can target businessmen, students and working class people with academic degree/ higher education as they have no difficulty in repayment.
- Bank can also approve loans taken on purpose for buying home or garage as there less chances of defaulting.
