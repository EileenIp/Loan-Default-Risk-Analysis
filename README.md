## Problem Overview

This case study demonstrates how exploratory data analysis (EDA) can be applied in a real-world business context, specifically in banking and financial services. The goal is to leverage data analytics to assess and mitigate lending risks, ensuring that financial institutions minimize losses while approving loans responsibly.

The study focuses on detecting patterns that signal potential repayment difficulties among loan applicants. These insights can guide key decisions, such as:

* Rejecting high-risk loan applications

* Adjusting loan amounts

* Charging higher interest rates for riskier borrowers

By using EDA, lenders can more accurately identify reliable borrowers, reducing the chances of rejecting creditworthy applicants.
